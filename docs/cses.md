# CSES Problem Set
The CSES Problem Set contains a collection of algorithm programming practice problems. These problems are identified to be one of the best set of problems to build algorithmic thinking in the CP community. This can be one of the best resources for learning algorithmic thinking.

    My texts are Object Oriented Solutions for Competitive programing problems which you will find nowhere else. Everywhere you'll see solutions with bunch of `#define` and variables named `i, j, k, a, b, c` with not exact in depth explaination given. My solutions are readable, extensible, reusable.

**Below** are few solutions for the **CSES problem set**. Find the CSES problem set [here $\to$](https://cses.fi/problemset/)
